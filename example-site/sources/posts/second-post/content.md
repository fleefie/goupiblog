<link rel="stylesheet" href="res/post-specific.css"/>

Look at that, post-specific CSS!

A custom tag: <GoupiCustomTag/>

Statistics class made me cry, I think this is the right formula?

$$
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi} \sigma} e^{\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2 \sigma ^2}}
$$

*note how it doesn't render, GoupiBlog features no JS by default, by design!*
